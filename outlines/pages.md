# SITE PAGE STRUCTURE
The web-app is a very simple app and only contains 2 main pages. 

- "ChatWindow" - the page where the user will engage in the chat with the different characters. This page will contain the character avatar in the middle, the chat ui to the right, and to the left will show multiple panels which will provide feedback to the user on the career profile and ranked career options currently reflected by the chat they are engaging in.

- "Dashboard" - This is a detailed screen which can be expanded from any of the panels displaying the user profile. It is a more comprehensive view that allows the user to navigate away from the chat and view their stats, info, and career options in more detail. From this page, they can enter back to the original chat, or start chatting with some new characters about key career options.
